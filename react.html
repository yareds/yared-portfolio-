								<h2>The Virtual DOM</h2>
								<p>Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the DOM,and it stays on the memory rather than user screen. An algorithm keeps a track of the changes made on the virtual DOM and determines which changes must make it to the real DOM and, thus, user screen. Let’s say the application contains a few React components with their own logic and rendering. Since React is fundamentally JavaScript, a single change in one of the components will manipulate the entire DOM, which if happens frequently may affect the performance as I described above.</p>
								<p>This is where Virtual DOM comes in. It absorbs any change to the DOM and keeps it to the memory. The algorithm then detects on which component the change was made and updates that part of the DOM. This change will reflect on the user screen without disturbing the other components.</p>

								<h2>JSX</h2>
								<p>JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.</p>
								<p>JSX provides you to write HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM-like tree structures) in the same file where you write JavaScript code, then preprocessor will transform these expressions into actual JavaScript code. Just like XML/HTML, JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children.</p>
